#How to play the game?

In this game we have a hero character(the player) trying to cross 3 layers of gravelled path and jump into the water. The player starts from the grass and tries to cross the gravelled path. The gravelled path has bugs(enemies) moving at random speeds from left to right.
If while crossing the gravelled path the player collides with a bug, he/she again goes back to the starting position.
If the player successfully jumps into the water without colliding with the bugs, he scores a 100 points.

Also, there are 3 types of colored gems appearing randomly on the gravelled path. They are blue, green and orange in color. While crossing the path the player can collect these gems as they appear and in this way score more points. The points for collecting gems are:
Blue gem : 100 points
Green gem: 200 points
Orange gem: 300 points

If a bug collides with the gems it collects the gem too.
The player should try to maximise points by collecting more gems while crossing the gravelled path without colliding with the enemy bugs and jumping into the water.
